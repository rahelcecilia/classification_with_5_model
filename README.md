# Classification With 5 Model
I am one of the participants in Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence by Start Up Campus organized by MSIB Batch 6. The following is my assignment regarding machine learning.<br>
<br> **Dataset** from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
#
Heart disease prediction is based on a public dataset that predicts whether existing traits indicate symptoms of heart disease. Machine Learning helps in predicting heart disease, and the predictions made are quite accurate. This project goes through several stages such as: Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Model Development, Model Evaluation, Model Comparison (Choosing Logistic Regression), Hyperparameter Tuning. 
<br><br>

**Feature Engineering**  <br>
Feature engineering is carried out to add new features that can produce more informative features. In this project, there are 10 new features : <br>
1. Blood sugar status <br>
2. Normal heartbeat <br>
3. Blood pressure status <br>
4. Chest pain status <br>
5. Cholesterol status <br>
6. Prediction of diabetes and hypertension <br>
7. Advice on chest pain <br>
8. Advice on diabetes <br>
9. Oldpeak Status (ST Depression) <br>
10. Status of blood vessel blockage (ca) <br>
<br>

**Machine Learning algorithms used:** <br>
1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)<br>
2. Support Vector Machine (Scikit-learn)<br>
3. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)<br>
4. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)<br>
5. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)<br>
<br>

**Summary** <br>
Based on the order of accuracy of each model, Logistic Regression was chosen because this model has the highest accuracy compared to the others.

|No|Model|Accuracy|
|-|-|-|
|1|Logistic Regression|0.901639|
|2|	Naive Bayes|	0.836066|
|3|	Random Forest|0.836066|
|4|	Decision Tree|	0.737705|
|5|	Support Vector Machines|	0.606557|
<br>

Next, the results of this model are visualized to make it easier to read. Please go to the following link to see the visualization dashboard.
